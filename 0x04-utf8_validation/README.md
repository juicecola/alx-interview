UTF-8 is a character encoding that represents each character in Unicode as a sequence of one to four bytes. The first byte of a multi-byte sequence contains information about the number of bytes in the sequence. UTF-8 encoding ensures that Unicode characters can be correctly represented, including characters from different languages and symbols.

UTF-8 validation is the process of checking if a given byte sequence is a valid UTF-8 encoding. To be valid, the byte sequence must follow specific rules defined in the UTF-8 encoding scheme. Some of the rules for valid UTF-8 encoding are:

A single byte character must have the most significant bit (MSB) set to 0.
A multi-byte character must start with a specific number of 1s in the MSB to indicate the number of bytes in the sequence.
Subsequent bytes in a multi-byte character must have the MSB set to 10.
A valid UTF-8 encoding cannot have overlapping sequences or use reserved code points.
