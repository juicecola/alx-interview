Rotating a 2D matrix means turning it around like a clock's hand. Imagine you have a piece of paper with numbers or pictures on it, and you want to turn the paper without changing the order of the numbers or pictures.

Here's how you can do it:

Transpose: First, you flip the numbers diagonally. It's like swapping the rows with columns. The top-left number goes to the top-right, the top-right goes to the bottom-right, and so on. This step changes the orientation of the matrix.

Reverse Rows: After you transpose, you reverse each row of the matrix. This means the numbers that were in the first column now become the last column, and the last column numbers become the first column.
