You are given a grid representing a map of land and water. The grid consists of 0's (water) and 1's (land). An "island" is formed by connecting adjacent lands (horizontally or vertically). Each cell is a square with side length 1. The grid's cells are connected, forming the perimeter of the island.

Calculate the perimeter of all the islands in the grid.
